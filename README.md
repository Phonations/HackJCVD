This project is about creating a smartphone app that would allow making video with Jean-Claude Van Damme himself using the awesome green background video he gaves to the community: https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=656928214432906

Using its phone embedded camera, the director will be able to record video with JCVD performance incrustated in live. When pressing stop, the recorded audio and video are mixed together and shareable on youtube or vimeo.

This project is non lucrative so let's make it big! Have a look on the issues if you want to contribute.
